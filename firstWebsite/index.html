      <p> Ada was an English mathematician and writer, and she is considered to be the first computer programmer. She is mainly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. This is considered to be a predecessor for the modern computer. </p>
      <p>"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything,” she wrote in one of those footnotes. “It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with.”</p>
